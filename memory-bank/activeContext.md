# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are transitioning to Phase 2 of the Click Urban e-commerce project, focusing on database implementation and backend functionality. We have completed the frontend UI components in Phase 1 and are now setting up the PostgreSQL database with Supabase.

## Recent Decisions
- **Database Provider**: Selected PostgreSQL through Supabase for the database
- **ORM**: Using Prisma as the ORM for database interactions
- **Schema Design**: Created a comprehensive database schema with models for users, products, categories, orders, etc.
- **API Routes**: Implementing Next.js API routes for CRUD operations
- **Environment Setup**: Configured environment variables for database connections
- **Design System**: Implemented a color palette based on dark blue, white, red, grey, and blue tones
- **Theme Toggle**: Created a light/dark mode toggle with system preference detection
- **Layout Components**: Developed responsive header and footer components
- **Homepage**: Implemented a hero section, featured products, categories, and newsletter sections
- **Image Handling**: Updated Next.js config to handle SVG images
- **Local Images**: Downloaded and integrated high-quality category and product images
- **Vercel Deployment Fix**: Updated build script to include `prisma generate` to fix Prisma client initialization error on Vercel

## Next Steps
1. Complete database migration and setup
2. Implement API routes for all entities (products, categories, users, orders)
3. Connect frontend components to the API
4. Set up authentication with Supabase
5. Implement product listing and detail pages with real data
6. Develop shopping cart functionality with database persistence
7. Build checkout flow with payment integration

## Active Considerations
- How to implement the product filtering and sorting functionality
- Best approach for the product image gallery with zoom
- Structure for the shopping cart state management
- Implementation of the checkout flow with multiple payment options
- Design and content for the About Us and Contact Us pages
- Authentication strategy with Supabase
- Database indexing for performance optimization
- Error handling and validation in API routes
- Testing strategy for API endpoints

## Project Insights
- The design system with CSS variables provides a flexible foundation for theming
- The responsive layout components ensure a consistent user experience across devices
- Using placeholder images for now, but will need to replace with actual product images
- The homepage layout provides a good showcase for featured products and categories
- The newsletter section will be valuable for marketing and customer engagement
- The Prisma ORM provides a type-safe way to interact with the database
- The API routes follow RESTful principles for consistency and predictability
- The database schema is designed to support all e-commerce functionality
- The modular approach to API routes makes the codebase maintainable

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring consistent styling across all components
- Implementing smooth animations and transitions for a polished user experience
- Planning for the product data structure to support future dropshipping integrations
- Balancing visual impact with performance, especially with image-heavy pages
- Managing database migrations and schema evolution
- Implementing proper error handling and validation in API routes
- Securing API endpoints with authentication and authorization
- Optimizing database queries for performance
- Handling file uploads and storage for product images
