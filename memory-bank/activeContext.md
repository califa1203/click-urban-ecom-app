# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are transitioning to Phase 2 of the Click Urban e-commerce project, focusing on database implementation and backend functionality. We have completed the frontend UI components in Phase 1 and are now setting up the PostgreSQL database with Supabase.

## Recent Decisions
- **Database Provider**: Selected PostgreSQL through Supabase for the database
- **ORM**: Using Prisma as the ORM for database interactions
- **Schema Design**: Created a comprehensive database schema with models for users, products, categories, orders, etc.
- **API Routes**: Implementing Next.js API routes for CRUD operations
- **Environment Setup**: Configured environment variables for database connections
- **Design System**: Implemented a color palette based on dark blue, white, red, grey, and blue tones
- **Theme Toggle**: Created a light/dark mode toggle with system preference detection and explicit class-based styling
- **Layout Components**: Developed responsive header and footer components
- **Homepage**: Implemented a hero section, featured products, categories, and newsletter sections
- **Image Handling**: Updated Next.js config to handle SVG images
- **Local Images**: Downloaded and integrated high-quality category and product images
- **Vercel Deployment Fix**: Updated build script to include `prisma generate` to fix Prisma client initialization error on Vercel
- **Code Structure Fix**: Removed duplicate prisma.ts file and lib directory at the root level to fix potential migration issues
- **Database Setup Solution**: Used non-pooled connection URL and `prisma db push` instead of migrations to successfully set up the database schema
- **Authentication Implementation**: Set up Supabase authentication with login/signup pages and role-based access control
- **File Upload Component**: Created a reusable file upload component using Supabase Storage for product images
- **Page Structure**: Created basic pages for products, categories, about, contact, and blog
- **Authentication UI**: Added sign-in/sign-up buttons to the header for easy access

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Complete database setup (Done)
2. ✅ Implement API routes for all entities (Done)
3. ✅ Set up authentication with Supabase (Done)
4. ✅ Implement file upload functionality for product images (Done)
5. ✅ Create basic page structure for all main sections (Done)
6. Connect frontend components to the API
7. Implement product listing and detail pages with real data
8. Develop shopping cart functionality with database persistence
9. Build checkout flow with payment integration

## Active Considerations
- How to implement the product filtering and sorting functionality
- Best approach for the product image gallery with zoom
- Structure for the shopping cart state management
- Implementation of the checkout flow with multiple payment options
- Authentication strategy with Supabase
- Database indexing for performance optimization
- Error handling and validation in API routes
- Testing strategy for API endpoints
- Implementing user profile and order history pages
- Adding product reviews and ratings functionality

## Project Insights
- The design system with CSS variables provides a flexible foundation for theming
- The responsive layout components ensure a consistent user experience across devices
- Using placeholder images for now, but will need to replace with actual product images
- The homepage layout provides a good showcase for featured products and categories
- The newsletter section will be valuable for marketing and customer engagement
- The Prisma ORM provides a type-safe way to interact with the database
- The API routes follow RESTful principles for consistency and predictability
- The database schema is designed to support all e-commerce functionality
- The modular approach to API routes makes the codebase maintainable
- The authentication system with Supabase provides a secure and scalable solution
- The role-based access control allows for different user permissions (admin vs regular users)
- The middleware approach to route protection is clean and maintainable
- The dark mode implementation now uses explicit class-based styling for better control
- The page structure follows a consistent pattern for maintainability

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring consistent styling across all components
- Implementing smooth animations and transitions for a polished user experience
- Planning for the product data structure to support future dropshipping integrations
- Balancing visual impact with performance, especially with image-heavy pages
- Managing database migrations and schema evolution
- Implementing proper error handling and validation in API routes
- Securing API endpoints with authentication and authorization
- Optimizing database queries for performance
- ~~Handling file uploads and storage for product images~~ (Solved with Supabase Storage integration)
- Implementing real-time stock and shipping updates for dropshipping
- Creating an efficient admin dashboard for product management
