# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are currently in Phase 1 of the Click Urban e-commerce dropshipping website development, focusing on the landing page and essential components. We have implemented the design system, layout components, and homepage.

## Recent Decisions
- **Design System**: Implemented a color palette based on dark blue, white, red, grey, and blue tones
- **Theme Toggle**: Created a light/dark mode toggle with system preference detection
- **Layout Components**: Developed responsive header and footer components
- **Homepage**: Implemented a hero section, featured products, categories, and newsletter sections
- **Image Handling**: Updated Next.js config to handle SVG images
- **Local Images**: Downloaded and integrated high-quality category and product images

## Next Steps
1. Create the product listing page with filtering and sorting capabilities
2. Implement the product detail page with image gallery and zoom functionality
3. Develop the shopping cart functionality with dynamic updates
4. Build the checkout flow with payment integration
5. Create the additional pages (About Us, Contact Us, Blog)

## Active Considerations
- How to implement the product filtering and sorting functionality
- Best approach for the product image gallery with zoom
- Structure for the shopping cart state management
- Implementation of the checkout flow with multiple payment options
- Design and content for the About Us and Contact Us pages

## Project Insights
- The design system with CSS variables provides a flexible foundation for theming
- The responsive layout components ensure a consistent user experience across devices
- Using placeholder images for now, but will need to replace with actual product images
- The homepage layout provides a good showcase for featured products and categories
- The newsletter section will be valuable for marketing and customer engagement

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring consistent styling across all components
- Implementing smooth animations and transitions for a polished user experience
- Planning for the product data structure to support future dropshipping integrations
- Balancing visual impact with performance, especially with image-heavy pages
